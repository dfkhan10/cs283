## Goals for the Class
Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class:  
"I want to deepen my understanding of systems programming concepts, particularly how to work effectively with low-level programming languages like C. I am also eager to learn more about memory management, file systems, and concurrency, as these are foundational skills for a career in software engineering."

## Concerns About Success
Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class (if any):  
"My main concern is staying on top of the coursework, especially since this is my first experience with some of the more advanced topics in systems programming. However, I plan to allocate sufficient time each week to study and complete assignments, and I will seek help from the professor and teaching assistants whenever necessary."
